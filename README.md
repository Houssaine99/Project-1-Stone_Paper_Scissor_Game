# 🪨📄✂️ Stone – Paper – Scissors (C++)

This project is a **C++ console implementation** of the classic **Stone (Rock) – Paper – Scissors** game.

The repository contains **two implementations of the same project**, each written with a different approach:

- **My Way** → learning-focused implementation  
- **Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud’s Way** → professional and structured implementation  

The main goal is to **compare problem-solving styles** and learn how the same problem can be solved differently.

## 🎮 Project Description

The game allows the user to play **Stone–Paper–Scissors** against the computer.

The program:
- Takes the user’s choice
- Generates a random computer choice
- Compares both choices
- Displays the result (win / lose / draw)
- Allows replaying the game

## 🔁 Two Different Approaches

### 🧑‍💻 My Way
- My personal solution while learning algorithms
- Focused on simplicity and understanding
- Logic written step by step
- Prioritizes readability over optimization
- Reflects my current learning level

This version helped me practice:
- Conditions
- Loops
- Functions
- Basic game logic
